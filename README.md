# OpenDeID-Pipeline

- We present a hybrid de-identification pipeline called OpenDeID, which was developed using an Australian multicenter EHR-based corpus called OpenDeID Corpus. 
- The OpenDeID corpus consisted of 2,100 pathology reports with 38,414 PHI entities from 1,833 patients. 
- The OpenDeID pipeline is suitable for processing Australian EHRs, which can generate realistic surrogates. 
- The OpenDeID pipeline has been deployed at a large tertiary teaching hospital and has processed over 8,000 unstructured EHRs in real-time.
